## User Create account/ Login

### New User
The default screen is a 'create account' form, which requires the user to enter their name, email, password & birthday. All information is *required*, so if the user tries to submit the form without filling everything in they will be reminded to fill in all of the input fields.

### Returning User
If the user already has an account they have the option to click 'Login Here' which pulls up a login page for returning users. This form only requires the user to enter their email & password to log in.

#### Forgot Password
If the user already has an account, but have forgotten their password, they can click on 'Forgot Password' which asks for the user to enter their email.

*** Results of the form will be submitted ***
